Abstract:
    ALMA observations of the Serpens South star-forming region suggest
    that stellar protoclusters may be completely mass segregated at birth.
    Independent observations also suggest that embedded clusters form
    segregated by mass.

    As the primordial mass segregation seems to be lost over time, we aim
    to study on which timescale an initially perfectly mass-segregated
    star cluster becomes indistinguishable from an initially not
    mass-segregated cluster. As an example, the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC)
    is also discussed.

    We used N-body simulations of star clusters with various masses and
    two different degrees of primordial mass segregation. We analysed
    their energy redistribution through two-body relaxation to quantify
    the time when the models agree in terms of mass segregation, which
    sets in only dynamically in the models that are primordially not mass
    segregated. A comprehensive cross-matched catalogue combining optical,
    infrared, and X-ray surveys of ONC members was also compiled and made
    available.

    The models evolve to a similar radial distribution of high-mass stars
    after the core collapse (about half a median two-body relaxation time,
    t_rh_) and become observationally indistinguishable from the point of
    view of mass segregation at time tau_v_~3.3t_rh_. In the case of the
    ONC, using the distribution of high-mass stars, we may not rule out
    either evolutionary scenario (regardless of whether they are initially
    mass segregated). When we account for extinction and elongation of the
    ONC, as reported elsewhere, an initially perfectly mass-segregated
    state seems to be more consistent with the observed cluster.

Description:
    We performed numerical simulations of star clusters represented
    by N-body models (i.e. idealised mathematical models without
    gas or interstellar medium).
